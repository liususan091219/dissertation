\chapter{Assisting Database Queries with Natural Language Interface}
\label{ch:nl2sql}

(this part of work is still ongoing, below I give an overview of the problem definition). 

People have started studying the natural language interface for SQL since 1980. The goal is to translate users' natural language queries to SQL queries. This research can help users who is not familiar with SQL language to interact with database, At that time, essentially the growing group of data analysts. There has not been large datasets for training. In recent years, people have created larger datasets, including the recent WikiSQL dataset and the Spider dataset. The Spider dataset is a relatively large dataset which supports many operations including JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING BY. I plan to study to potentially improve an existing framework, SyntaxSQLNet, on the Spider dataset.
