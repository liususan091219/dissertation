\begin{abstract}

Mobile devices are ubiquitous in people's lives. As mobile users are expected to exceed 4.5 billion in 2019, mobile devices are the closest approach for users to communicate with the outside world. It is important to ensure such communication goes smoothly. That is, on the one hand, users can easily and conveniently express their need to the system, and on the other hand, users should be able to understand and trust the requests and decisions from the system.

Same as in other software platforms, poor communications between users and mobile devices can result in the failure in requirements understanding, reduction of system reliability and lower user satisfaction. However, the communication on mobile devices is especially challenging due to three unique characteristics of mobile devices. First, it is more difficult to perform typing on mobile devices, also mobile users highly rely on voice input~\cite{voicesearch,googlevoicesearch}, the two facts limit the types of information that users can conveniently input on mobile devices (e.g., technical terms, programming language). Second, mobile screens are smaller, which limits the amount of information that users can focus on at the same time. Third, the challenges in mobile security and privacy directly caused the challenge in user trust, transparency issue and communication problems regarding how user privacy is protected over mobile devices~\cite{location}.

This thesis seeks to provide a holistic picture on the new communication challenges brought by mobile devices. More specifically, it studies the communication through natural language because the natural language is the most common way for end users to communicate. This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the background of formal communication models, then introduces the unique communication problem on mobile devices. The three challenges above are discussed from Chapter 2 to Chapter 4. For each challenge, we first provide an overview of the state of the art in existing literature, or perform empirical study to gain understanding on questions that are yet to be answered. Then, based on the analysis results, we identify feasible technical problems, and build solutions to support the communication process. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes the remaining challenges, discusses the future work and draw the conclusion.
